# tagbox

### Tagbox is an addition to a wordpress plugin called [DWQA](https://www.designwall.com/wordpress/plugins/dw-question-answer/). 

<br>

_Background_: 

We started using DWQA for our questions and answers website and it felt quite OK, except for that some functions were missing. We missed some kind of "subscribe to tag" function, so we asked the guys who made the DWQA-plugin to develop the missing functionality but they were obviously too buys. While waiting for support we came up with our own solution. 

<br>

### Tagbox presents a textbox when hovering above a tag. The textbox reveals the following info about the tag...

* subscribe and ubsubscribe links
* number of questions asked today and this week
* description of tag
* number of questions with this tag
* number of subscribers to this tag

<br>

## How to install

- copy the dwqa.tar file to your wordpress plugin folder and unpack it
- restart wordpress

<br>

### Misc

The addon is tested on wordpress 4.8.5

# ToDo
